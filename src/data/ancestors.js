    ],
    story: [
      "James came into the world in the middle of World War II, born into a crowded Black household in Beaumont’s refinery belt. Hemlock Street, where he grew up, was ringed by siblings, cousins, and neighbors who worked at refineries, went to segregated schools, and built community through churches and schools that served as both sanctuary and backbone.",
      "In 1955, when James was about ten, his mother Jane died in San Francisco. Her body was brought back to Beaumont for burial. He grew up in the long echo of that loss, raised within a big family where older siblings helped hold up the roof beams of everyday life.",
      "In July 1965, during the Vietnam era, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served until July 1967. By the mid-1970s, James was living in San Francisco, where he met my mother, Joyce Ellen Perry, in 1976. She later went to Houston while pregnant, where I was born in 1977, and then returned to Michigan to live in Lansing at her brother Edwin’s house while I was a baby.",
    ],
    worldAround: [
      "James’s life spans Jim Crow Texas, the Civil Rights era, and the Vietnam War. His childhood was shaped by segregated neighborhoods and Black institutions built to endure. His young adulthood unfolded during the western branch of the Great Migration, when Texas and Louisiana families reshaped the Bay Area’s Black communities street by street.",
    ],
    legacy: [
      "On paper, James is a Milburn son; genetically he also carries the Tatum/Davis line of educators. Through him, refinery-town roots and Black professional-class roots converge and continue forward in me.",

      "Marriage: Richard Charles Milburn, 26 October 1921, Jefferson County, Texas",
    ],
    story: [
      "Jane’s life begins in Opelousas, Louisiana, in a Black family making its way in the decades after Reconstruction. As a girl she moved with her parents, Henry and Amelia, along the Gulf Coast corridor from St. Landry Parish to Beaumont, Texas, part of a broader wave of families following industrial work and the promise of a steadier paycheck.",
      "By adulthood she was rooted in Beaumont’s tightly-knit Black neighborhoods, close enough that certain street names repeat like a chorus: Hemlock, McKinley, Brookland, Poplar. In 1921 she married Richard Charles Milburn and built a home on Hemlock Street that became a launchpad for a very big family.",
      "Over the next two decades that house filled with children who would carry the Milburn name into WWII, Korea, Vietnam, postal routes, and shipyards, from Texas to California. In the early 1950s, Jane followed family west to San Francisco. She died there in 1955, and her burial back in Beaumont ties Louisiana, Texas, and California into one life story.",
    ],
    worldAround: [
      "Jane lived through Jim Crow segregation, the Great Depression, and World War II. Her adult years coincide with Beaumont’s transformation into a refinery hub, with Black neighborhoods providing essential labor while also building their own churches, schools, and mutual support networks.",
    ],
    legacy: [
      "Jane’s greatest legacy is relational: a large family held together by work, faith, and shared geography. Decades after her death, her youngest son James met my mother in San Francisco. My mother went to Houston where I was born, and then to Lansing, Michigan. Jane never lived to see me, but the migration pattern she helped set in motion, Opelousas → Beaumont → San Francisco, continues directly into my story.",
    ],
    notes: [
      "Her story links Opelousas, Beaumont, and San Francisco into a single arc.",
      "Those repeating Beaumont street names are a clue: this was a walkable, interconnected community, not scattered relatives living at random.",

      "Work: Refinery and industrial labor (a steady working life rather than a glamorous one)",
    ],
    story: [
      "Richard’s story begins in Louisiana and shifts to Texas in the way many Gulf Coast stories do: following work. Beaumont was becoming a refinery town, and Black labor powered much of the physical growth of the city while Black neighborhoods built parallel institutions to survive segregation.",
      "Before the Hemlock house became the family landmark, Richard experienced early grief. His first marriage (to Laura Savoie) brought three infant sons who did not live long. Those losses sit behind the later image of a bustling household: a reminder that large family trees often have invisible roots of mourning.",
      "In World War I, Richard served in the U.S. Army and returned to Beaumont in 1919. In 1921 he married Jane Simmons. Together they built the long-running center of gravity of this branch of the family: Hemlock Street, a home where children grew up, left for war or work, returned with spouses, and eventually migrated west.",
      "Richard’s life wasn’t marked by dramatic titles, but by something just as consequential: steadiness. A job, a home, a neighborhood, and decades of family continuity in a time when the outside world worked hard to deny Black families that kind of stability.",
    ],
    worldAround: [
      "Richard lived through the full span of the 20th century’s biggest American shifts: Jim Crow and the Great Migration, the Depression, World War II, and the Civil Rights era. His children’s lives mirror the era’s movement patterns, especially the Texas-to-California corridor.",
    ],
    legacy: [
      "Richard is the anchor figure of the Hemlock household. Even where DNA suggests a more complicated biology for James, Richard’s role as the household father remains central to how the family story was lived and remembered.",

    notes: [
      "Two kinds of legacy can exist at once: the legal/social father in the home, and the biological father in the background.",

    story: [
      "Henry’s life begins in Louisiana in the decades when freedom existed on paper but safety and opportunity were constantly contested. The family story moves along a familiar rail: rural beginnings, work wherever it can be found, and the slow building of stability through family and home.",
      "By the early 1900s Henry and Amelia Barber were raising children while moving along the Gulf Coast corridor. Their arrival in Beaumont placed them in a growing industrial town where Black families built neighborhoods close to work, but also close to one another.",
      "Henry’s adulthood reads like the story of countless Black working men of that era: labor that kept the city running, and a home life that tried to hold steady through economic pressure, illness, and the early deaths that were far too common.",
      "When Henry died in 1932, his daughter Jane was already an adult with children of her own. His story doesn’t end with him. It continues on Hemlock Street, and later in California, in the lives of the grandchildren and great-grandchildren who followed the path he opened.",
    ],
    worldAround: [
      "Henry lived through the tightening grip of Jim Crow, when Black families relied heavily on church, kinship networks, and neighborhood solidarity. Beaumont’s growth promised jobs, but also intensified segregation and inequality.",
    ],
    legacy: [
      "Henry’s legacy is movement and groundwork: the decision to relocate, the work to keep a household afloat, and the creation of a Beaumont base that later generations would return to, leave from, and remember.",

    story: [
      "Amelia’s life is the kind that rarely gets a headline, even though it makes all the headlines possible. She grew up in Louisiana and married Henry Simmons Jr, building a family in an era when Black women carried enormous responsibility with limited protection.",
      "By the time the family reached Beaumont, Amelia’s work shows up in records the way women’s work often does: as 'laundry' or 'domestic' labor. But that labor was economic strategy. It was cash flow. It was survival. It was the quiet arithmetic that kept children fed and clothed while the world outside stayed hostile.",
      "Amelia died in 1928, before her daughter Jane’s story reached its full arc. But Amelia’s influence remains in the shape of the family itself: children raised, literacy and church life reinforced, and the steady insistence that the future would be bigger than the present.",
    ],
    worldAround: [
      "Amelia lived during the post-Reconstruction backlash and the cementing of Jim Crow. Black women’s labor, both paid and unpaid, kept families functioning while communities built institutions in parallel to exclusionary systems.",

    story: [
      "Robert Tatum’s life steps into a different lane of the same road. Where some branches of the family story are refinery shifts and wartime service, Robert’s branch is classrooms, principals’ offices, and the stubborn insistence that Black children deserved more than leftovers.",
      "He rose into the Black professional class of early 20th-century Texas, connected to teacher organizations and Black newspapers that circulated ideas alongside announcements, obituaries, and community news. In Beaumont, that meant operating in the heart of a Black neighborhood where schools, churches, and civic groups overlapped within a few blocks.",
      "If the DNA story is correct, Robert’s influence reaches directly into my own life through James Clarence Milburn. That possibility reframes the family tree: not as separate Milburn and Tatum stories, but as parallel lines running through the same streets, the same era, the same community ecosystem in Beaumont.",
      "Seen from a distance, Robert’s legacy can look official, even formal. Seen up close, it looks like the daily work of leadership: persuading, organizing, teaching, pushing against underfunding, and building something durable under pressure.",
    ],
    worldAround: [
      "Robert lived at the height of Jim Crow, when Black schools were systematically underfunded. Black teacher networks and professional organizations were both advocacy and survival tools, creating opportunity where the state refused to.",

    legacy: [
      "Robert’s legacy is education and influence: leadership that shaped Black students in Beaumont and strengthened wider networks of Black educators. If he is James’s biological father, his legacy also becomes personal: a hidden thread that leads directly to me through James’s later life in San Francisco and my own birth in Houston.",

In that world, marriage and family weren’t just personal. They were structure, labor-sharing, and the first line of protection.",
      "He married Eliza Davis in 1889 and became father to children who would later form a remarkably education-centered family branch. That contrast is one of the most striking patterns in the story: how quickly a family can move from survival mode to leadership mode within a generation or two, even under harsh conditions.",
      "Records suggest the household later shifted, with J.R. remarrying and forming a second set of children. That kind of branching isn’t unusual. It’s a reminder that family trees are often shaped by loss, separation, and second starts, not only by neat, continuous timelines.",
