      <p>
        This site is a personal family history project, combining traditional
        records, DNA evidence, and historical context to tell the stories of
        the people who eventually led to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of these stories focus on Black communities in Louisiana, Texas,
        California, and beyond — especially the Milburn, Simmons, Tatum, Barber,
        Ruffins, White, and Davis lines.
